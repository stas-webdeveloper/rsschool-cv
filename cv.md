  <summary>More on my motivation and goals</summary>

Growing up as a millennial, I had a phone in my hands and was constantly engaged with the internet and social media, which significantly impacted my life. It opened up many possibilities I would not have had otherwise.

I experienced how the internet has been a disruptive innovation and a robust social equalizer. As a curious and grateful consumer, I am eventually <mark>becoming</mark> a creator myself. My professional goal is to make the web a better place for everyone, one page at a time!
